## How to Run the Analysis
The order in which to run the analyses is:
  
  1. Methylation Regression Analysis
  2. RNA-Seq Analysis
  3. eQTM Analysis
  
In each of these folders contains a jupyter notebook with the R code to replicate our results. You can extract the code by copying to a new Rscript or you can use an irkernel + jupyter to execute the notebook.
  
If you have trouble running the scripts, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:pcallen@hudsonalpha.org).
